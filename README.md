# ChatForm

ChatForm is a Django-based forum-style web application that prioritizes user experience and introduces a fresh, captivating design. This project provided an opportunity to sharpen my skills in Git, web development, and full-stack programming. ChatForm is not just about discussionâ€”it's about community, connection, and a seamless user experience.
