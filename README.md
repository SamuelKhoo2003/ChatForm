# ChatForm
 This is a Django-based project where I enhanced my skills in using Git, web app development and full-stack skeletal code frames. 
 It gave me insight towards managing databases, designing user models, authentication services and 
 ChatForm is my take on a forum-style app focused on the user experience and incorporating a new style which aims to captivate the user.

 The project is deployed on: http://samuelkhoo.pythonanywhere.com/

 In the future, I plan to add more features to enhance users' connectivity. These include:
  - include an edit message option 
  - include the creation of rooms and topics in the activity feed
  - include decluttering features (reduce the number of rooms and activities initially shown, maybe a more tab or arrow down to extend)
  - include a follower system where you can switch your feed to show a version which only displays content from individuals you follow
